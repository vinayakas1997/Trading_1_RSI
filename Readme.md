# Rsi divergence 

1. I am trying to get the minimum and maximaum points from the 5 candles before and after the current the candle 
2. to draw the slopes of the line I am looking at the 20 candles behind for it 
3. If maxima slope connnected by the maximas points and minima slope connected by the minimas from the past 20 candles 
      - If both slopes are positive then it is considered to be the uptrend 
      - If both slopes are negative thehn it is considered to be the downtrend 

# Note : The variable parameters taht con be considered to be for fine tuning 
        1. First level: 
            - No of candles consideration-> *5 
            - same fo the slopes 
        2. Sendond level: 
            - the elevation of the channel formed by the slopes- the slope value 
            - the width of the channel formed
